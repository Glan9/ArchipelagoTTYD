# ArchipelagoTTYD

This is a fork to implement glitch logic. I have also made a few minor modifications to the glitchless logic.

Use the `glitches_required` setting in the YAML to configure which logic to use: `glitchless` or `glitches`.

The first pass at glitch logic **will not include tattlesanity**.

Important information about the randomizer can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesbrq/ArchipelagoTTYD/blob/main/docs/en_Paper%20Mario%20The%20Thousand-Year%20Door.md)

Mod is hosted seperately over at https://github.com/jamesbrq/TTYDAP

## Changes to Glitchless Logic
_Italics_ indicate possibilities that I added.
- The water switch in the Great Tree can be hit with Koops _or Yoshi_ (by hovering to it from the button).
- Getting past the bars in Hooktail Castle (toward the spike room) can be done with Koops, _Bobbery, or Paper Mode_.
- The firebar room in Palace of Shadow can be cleared using Tube Mode _or Vivian_
- Rafters room in Hooktail Castle seemed to require plane mode to reach the Star Piece. This is not true and this was corrected.
- The spike wall room in Pirate's Grotto can be cleared with Tube Mode _or Vivian_.

## Required Tricks for Glitch Logic
- Superjumps: only expected using Koops with either Bobbery's house door or teleporter room door, however it can be expected to deathwarp with jump storage to carry it into other locations which have save blocks.
- Text Storage/Time Stop using Goombella and Ultra Boots
- Yoshi Teleports (only vertical ones and only in a couple spots)
- Fish Glitch
- Hazard Respawn Glitch
- HP Plus under the bridge at Hooktail Castle using Plane Mode
- Grabbing the Life Shroom in Hooktail Castle by using Koops or Yoshi from the moving block
- Rafters Star Piece in Hooktail Castle with Ultra Boots
- Using Yoshi to hover from the raised block to the end platform in the rafters room
- In Hooktail Castle, falling from the final big yellow block to the small purple block Star Piece using Yoshi
- Puni glitches, including water switch skip
- Beating 100 Jabbis with 91 Punis (and Flurrie)
- Skipping the 100-Jabbi Fight with Jabbi Hive Skip (while only controlling 11 Punis)
- Cage Skip
- Bookcase Jump
- Gate Handle Early
- Grotto Back Entrance (with Fish Glitch, **not** superjumps as this is too annoying and unreliable on US)
- Clearing the Palace of Shadow firebar room using i-frames with either Koops or Yoshi
